    <h1>About polt</h1>
     <p>The narrator explains that, as a young boy, he once drew a picture of a boa 
     constrictor digesting an elephant in its stomach; however, every adult who saw the 
     picture would mistakenly interpret it as a drawing of a hat. Whenever the narrator 
     would try to correct this confusion, he was ultimately advised to set aside drawing 
     and take up a more practical or mature hobby. The narrator laments the crass materialism
     of contemporary society and the lack of creative understanding displayed by adults. 
     As noted by the narrator, he could have had a great career as a painter, but this 
      opportunity was crushed by the misunderstanding of the adults.</p>
