    <h1>The Little Prince</h1>
     <p>The little prince is a wisp of a boy with curly golden hair and a laugh that sounds 
     like a million little bells. Remember this well! If you see him in your hood, give the 
     narrator a holler. (Shmoop thinks he’ll be easy to spot, especially if he’s wearing his 
     fancy greatcoat and sword – unless, of course, he’s hanging around at one of those 
     Renaissance Fairs.)</p>

    <h1>The Narrator</h1>
     <p>When you read this book, were you surprised to find out that it was narrated by an adult? 
     We were! To be completely honest, the book’s wonderful illustrations had grabbed our 
     attention, and we were mildly disappointed that an adult narrator had wandered into its 
     pages.</p>
     <p>We shouldn’t have worried, though, because even though the narrator is a grown up, 
     he’s a child at heart. And though he tells the story, the star of this tale is the little 
     prince.</p>

    <h1>The Fox</h1>
     <p>Although he only has a cameo role, the fox is a super-duper important character in this 
    book. He teaches the prince lessons that the prince then teaches the narrator (and by 
    extension us, the readers.)</p>

    <h1>The Rose</h1>
     <p>The prince’s love for his flower causes him much pain and heartbreak. Let’s try to 
    understand her better to see what all the fuss is about.</p>

    <h1>The Snake</h1>
     <p>Is it possible to come across any snake in literature and not think of that snake? You 
    know, the one in the Bible and Paradise Lost—the one that’s actually Satan.</p>
    <p>From all of this, it’s hard to know when, in literature, you can or should trust a snake. 
    In The Little Prince, the narrator certainly doesn’t trust the snake. He doesn’t want it 
    anywhere near the prince.</p>
    <p>But the prince sees the snake differently. He isn’t afraid of it, and converses with it
    as if it were just another one of the creatures he meets on his travels. And the snake, 
    too, seems to treat the prince with respect. It’s the snake who tells the prince, “This 
    is the Earth; this is Africa” (17.7) when the prince wants to know which planet he is on. 
    And when the prince points to the sky, to his own planet, the snake remarks that it is 
    “beautiful” (17.12). Nothing overtly evil about the snake as yet—in fact, he seems to be 
    quite a chatty fellow, and wise, too. When the prince remarks, “It is a little lonely in 
    the desert…” (17.16), the snake replies that it “is also lonely among men” (17.17).</p></br>
